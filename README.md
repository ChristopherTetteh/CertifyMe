CertifyMe is an innovative Academic Blockchain Database built on the 
Ethereum blockchain. It serves as a decentralized platform that empowers student certifications.
With CertifyMe, students can create and manage their academic profiles, including 
their educational qualifications, certifications, and research contributions. The 
platform leverages the immutability and transparency of the Ethereum blockchain, 
ensuring the authenticity and tamper-proof nature of the stored data.
